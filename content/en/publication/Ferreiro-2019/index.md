abstract: Tolypeutes matacus is categorized as Near Threatened (NT) as a population decline of close to 30% is suspected in the last 10-12 years due to widespread habitat loss across much of its range, and intense use made of the species as a source of food by local populations. However, it has a wide distribution and is registered in numerous protected areas. Therefore, it is close to being classified as Vulnerable under the A2cd criteria.
